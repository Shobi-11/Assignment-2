Dcoument Object Vs Window Object

    * The “Document Object” represents a webpage structure that is inserted in the DOM tree hierarchy and when compiled the content gets displayed on the webpage. 
By getting access to the document object,the users can access the HTML webpage content along with the elements by which the webpage is built.
On the other hand, the “Window Object” is at the head position of the DOM hierarchy showing a window browser or frame.


DOCUMENT OBJECT:-
-> The Document Object Model is the one on which the whole webpage is standing, it contains HTML elements that are placed in the form of a hierarchy tree.
When it is compiled transforms the element into the form of a webpage. 
-> To use the Document object, the following syntax will be used:
        
        document.property_name;

When the 'propertyName' is the name of the property available in the DOM whose data is going to be retrieved.

EXAMPLE PROGRAM FOR DOCUMENT OBJECT:-

    <h1> Document Object</h1>

    <button onclick="retriever()">Press to Retrieve Document Object</button>

    <p id="target"></p>

    <script>

    function retriever() {

    var docTitle = document.title;

    var docBody = document.body;

    document.getElementById("target").innerHTML =

    "Title of the document is: " + docTitle + "<br>" + "body : " + docBody;

    }

    </script>


Program Explanation:-

            i)    First, the button is created that utilizes the “onclick” event listener to call the “retriever()” function.
            ii)   Next, the “retriever()” function body is created that retrieves the “title” and “body” information 
                      by using the “document.title” and “document.body” properties.
            iii)  Then, this retrieved information is stored in “docTitle” and “docBody” and displayed on the web page using the “innerHTML” property.


WINDOW OBJECT:-
    
    * The Windows Object Model or “WOM” is a framework used by Microsoft Windows operating systems to represent and interact with various system components,
            like Windows, controls, menus, and other GUI elements. 
    * It is based on a binary interface standard used in Windows for inter-process communication and component interaction.
